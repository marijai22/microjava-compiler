# 🧠 MicroJava Compiler – Java-Based Compiler Implementation

This project is an implementation of a compiler for **MicroJava**, a simplified subset of the Java programming language. It was developed as part of the *Programming Languages and Compilers* coursework and demonstrates the complete compilation pipeline, from source code analysis to executable code generation.

## ⚙️ About the Project

The compiler processes MicroJava source programs and translates them into executable code for a virtual machine. It includes all essential phases of compilation, providing a clear and structured example of compiler construction principles.

The project focuses on correctness, modularity, and a clear separation of compilation stages.

## 🧩 Compiler Phases

The MicroJava compiler implements the following components:

* **Lexical Analysis** – tokenization of source code
* **Syntax Analysis** – parsing based on the MicroJava grammar
* **Semantic Analysis** – type checking, symbol table management, and semantic validation
* **Code Generation** – generation of bytecode for execution on a virtual machine

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Language**: Java
* **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming
* **Target**: Custom Virtual Machine execution

## 📚 Course Context

This project was developed as part of an academic course focused on **compiler design and implementation**. It serves as a practical application of formal language theory, parsing techniques, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding the full compiler pipeline
* Applying formal grammar and parsing techniques
* Implementing semantic checks and symbol tables
* Generating executable code for a virtual machine
* Writing structured, maintainable compiler code in Java
